If you want to access redux global store then you don't need action or action creators. Action or Action creators used when you want to update the state by comparing previous state and it gives modified state without mutating original state.

In this repo, I have used reducer with default state and used connect method to connect react components with redux global store pass by mapStateToProps function.
